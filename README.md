# Consumer Price Index (CPI) Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project analyzes the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key indicator of inflation, to understand trends and patterns in consumer prices over time. The CPI measures changes in the prices paid by urban consumers for a representative basket of goods and services, including food, housing, income, crime and more. By examining CPI data, we aim to gain insights into inflation rates and their impact on the economy.

## Data Source
The CPI data used in this project is sourced from kaggle. The dataset contains monthly CPI values for various categories and subcategories over a specific time period. 

## Files
- `Consumer Price Index.pdf`: Slides of the project analysis
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.


## Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**: The raw CPI data is cleaned to handle missing values
2. **Visualization**: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, we create visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to visualize CPI trends and patterns.
3. **Inflation Rate Calculation**: We calculate the inflation rate based on changes in CPI values over time, providing insights into the rate of price increase.
